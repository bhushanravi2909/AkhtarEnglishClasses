        <p style="text-align:justify; padding:10px; font-size:18px;">Let me extend a very hearty welcome to all prospective parents who have shown an interest in Akhtar English Classes. The major driving force behind my taking up this institute project has been the mixed experience of a variety of parents with regard to public institute in India.My own children went to one of the best public institute in the country and this gave me an opportunity of observing very closely various good and also some other not so good features of the public institute education system. Most of the institutes are, unfortunately, still following the western pattern of daily routine, while I strongly feel that there is a need for customization in the public school system, reorienting it to Indian culture and traditions. Keeping this in view we have experimented in a small way and initiated a few changes, which have already started bearing fruit.At the Akhtar English Classes, we help the children to tap their hidden potential by exposing them to diverse opportunities and a large number of activities. The board based, liberal education also helps them to rise above parochial mindsets and acquire a truly international outlook. In addition to this, children are trained to learn more by doing things themselves and trying out new ideas, taking failure and success in their stride, with all their energies focused on honest and purposeful effort.I have every hope and belief that The Akhtar English Classes is going to become a premier institute of its kind in this part of the world in the near future, amply fulfilling the educational aspirations of the parents who bring their children to its portals. </p>
